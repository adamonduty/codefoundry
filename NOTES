== Syntax Highlighting ==

Syntax highlighting uses harsh, which depends on ultraviolet (gem) and
Oniguruma.  Oniguruma is a C regex library that needs to be installed from
source.  It can be found here:
* http://www.geocities.jp/kosako3/oniguruma/archive/onig-5.9.2.tar.gz

environment.rb sets config.gem lines for oniguruma and ultraviolet.  The
oniguruma gem is required so that `rake gems:install` will fail unless the
oniguruma C library is installed.  Ultraviolet probably would as well, but it's
more clear to fail because of oniguruma rather than ultraviolet.

Harsh is managed as a git sub-module in vendor/plugins.  See
[http://woss.name/blog/2008/4/9/using-git-submodules-to-track-plugins.html this
page] for more information on submodules and plugins.  In short, to set up
submodule plugins after an initial clone or after a new submodule is added,
run:
 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update
